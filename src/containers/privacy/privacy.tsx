          <h3>Scope</h3>
          <p>
            This Privacy Policy covers Seekr Inc.'s treatment of personally
            identifiable information that may be collected while you are on a
            Seekr Inc. site, when you order and/or use its products or services
            or that is shared with Seekr Inc. by its business partners. This
            policy does not apply to the practices of companies not owned or
            controlled by Seekr Inc. or to people whom Seekr Inc. does not
            employ or manage, nor does it address non-personally identifiable
            information. The policy specifically addresses the following areas:
            <ul>
              <li>
                What personally identifiable information is collected by Seekr
                Inc. or by any third party through our site and/or via our
                products or services;
              </li>
              <li>How Seekr Inc. uses this information;</li>
              <li>With whom Seekr Inc. may share this information;</li>
              <li>
                What choices are available to you as a user of the site and/or
                products and services with respect to collection, use and
                distribution of the information;
              </li>
              <li>
                What types of security procedures are in place to protect the
                loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control; and
              </li>
              <li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="section-block">
          <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
          <p>
            Seekr Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected on this
            site or via our products and services. Seekr Inc. may collect
            information from you at the following three different stages:
          </p>
          <p>
            First, we collect anonymous, aggregate information from all visitors
            to the site and users of our products and services. This information
            is never linked to any personally identifiable information and is
            only used in the aggregate to generate statistical reports about the
            use of our site, products and services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Second, Seekr Inc. collects personally identifiable information when
            you create a Seekr Inc. account and when you order Seekr Inc.
            products or utilize certain services. Online account creation may
            require you to submit the following personal information: name,
            address, date of birth, company information, email address, driver’s
            license number and phone number. For purposes of billing, you may
            need to provide your credit card type, number, expiration date and
            billing address for the card. Certain personally identifiable
            information is required if you subscribe to a Seekr Inc. newsletter,
            or sign up to participate in a promotion, sweepstake or survey
            through the site. Seekr Inc. may also receive personally
            identifiable information from our business partners.
          </p>
          <p>
            Third, we collect certain personally identifiable information when
            you use a Seekr Inc. account. This information primarily consists of
            user access credentials. This data may include data directly
            provided by our users or related facilities operators, such as the
            recipient’s name, email or other digital channel address, as well as
            indirect information, known as metadata, such as the geographical
            location of the recipient.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className="section-block">
          <h3>Personal Information of Children Under 13</h3>

        <div className="section-block">
          <h3>Use of Your Personal Information</h3>
          <p>
            Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide
            you with a smooth, efficient and customized experience while using

            Seekr Inc. will never give your information to, or share your
            information with, any third party not affiliated with or owned by
            Seekr Inc., except as permitted by law. Seekr Inc. will send
            personally identifiable information about you to other companies or
            people when:
            <ul>
              <li>We have your consent to share the information;</li>
              <li>
                We need to share your information to provide the products or
                services you have requested;
              </li>
              <li>
                We need to send the information to companies who work on behalf
                of Seekr Inc. to provide a product or service to you. (Unless we

                use the personally identifiable information we provide to them
                beyond what is necessary to assist us); or
              </li>
              <li>
                We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process or find
                that your actions violate Seekr Inc. Terms of Service or any of
                our usage guidelines for specific products or services.

          <p>
            We store information that we collect through cookies and log files
            to create a profile of our customers. A profile is stored
            information detailing how individual customers use the site.
            Collected information in a profile is tied to the customer’s

          </p>
          <h5>Cookies</h5>
          <p>
            A cookie is a small text file stored on the customer’s hard drive
            for an extended period of time. The cookies can be removed by
            following Internet browser help file directions. Allowing a Seekr
            Inc. cookie to remain on your computer makes it easier for you to
            log in to and use the site.
          </p>
          <h5>Log files</h5>
          <p>

            internet service provider (ISP) referring/exit pages, platform type,
            date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer

          <h3>Disclosure of Personal Information As Required By Law</h3>
          <p>
            We will disclose personal information when required by law, or if we
            have good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) comply
            with current judicial proceedings, a court order or legal process
            served on us, (b) protect and defend our rights, or (c) protect the
            rights, property, and other interests of our users or others.

          <h3>Business Transitions</h3>
          <p>
            In the event that Seekr Inc. goes through a business transition,
            such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of a
            portion of its assets, our customers’ personal information may be
            part of the assets transferred. Customers will be notified via
            prominent notice on our site prior to a change of ownership or
            control of their personal information. If, as a result of the
            business transaction, your personally identifiable information will
            be used in a manner materially different from that stated at the
            time of collection, you will be given a choice consistent with our

            appropriate steps to protect the personal information that you share
            with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, given the
            nature of the Internet and the fact that network security measures

            information. We use encryption to protect sensitive information
            online. The servers that store your personally identifiable
